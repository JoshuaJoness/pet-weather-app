This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<!-- About this project -->
This project is part of an assessment for GasBuddy. I added an extra page here to connect to the 'create pet' ('/create') endpoint. This is so that user's can add pets to the index from the client.

The homepage ('/') displays thumbnails for each pet in the database

Clicking on a thumbnail will redirect to a page ('/pet/:id')containing more info for that particular pet

<!-- Running locally -->
To start the project on your local machine:

You will have to download the dependencies ('npm install')

Create a .env file and supply your localhost and Dark Sky API key
